<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
<p>
I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems and building things that help people. Writing code gives me the ability to turn ideas into working tools â€” from automating tedious tasks to creating delightful user experiences. I like the constant learning curve in this field: every project introduces new concepts and challenges, and that keeps my curiosity alive. Beyond the technical side, I appreciate the collaboration with other developers, designers, and stakeholders to craft solutions that are both elegant and practical. Ultimately, developing software lets me combine creativity, logic, and impact in a career I find deeply rewarding.
